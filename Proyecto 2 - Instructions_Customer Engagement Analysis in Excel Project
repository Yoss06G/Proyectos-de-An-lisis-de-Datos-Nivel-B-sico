# Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel

## Project Description
In 2022, 365 company had high expectations for growth and increased student engagement due to the introduction of new website platform features. These features included an XP system to track progress, in-app coins for rewards, a leaderboard for student competition, and streaks to encourage consistent learning habits. Additionally, the company expanded its course library to provide a richer set of skills, aiming to attract a larger audience and improve the student experience.

This project focuses on analyzing whether these platform improvements led to increased student engagement. Specifically, the analysis will evaluate the minutes watched by students in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022 to assess engagement trends.

## Project Files
The project files are based on a dataset from the 365 company. The dataset is anonymized to protect user privacy, and its volume is reduced for practical analysis. However, the dataset represents the company's operations accurately.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **student_id**: A unique identifier for each student in the dataset. This ID represents students who used the 365 Data Science platform in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022.
- **student_country**: Indicates the country of each student, useful for geographic analysis.
- **Paid**: A binary variable indicating whether a student had a paid account (1) or a free account (0) during the period.
- **minutes_watched_21**: The total number of minutes watched by a student in Q4 2021.
- **minutes_watched_22**: The total number of minutes watched by a student in Q4 2022.

### Project File: `Engagement Project.xlsx`
The Excel file consists of four sheets:
- **Task 1 and 2**: Contains descriptive statistics and data analysis results for the engagement data.
- **Task 3**: Contains confidence interval calculations for engagement data.
- **Task 4**: Performs hypothesis testing based on the engagement data.
- **Task 5**: Performs further hypothesis testing and concludes based on the data analysis.
